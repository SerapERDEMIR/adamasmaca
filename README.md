<u>Random Word Generation:</u>

When the page is loaded, a random word is selected using JavaScript. This ensures a different experience each time the game is initiated.

<u>Letter Control and Warnings:</u>

If the same letter is entered for the second time, the user is notified. This helps the game progress fairly and smoothly.

</u>Visual Progress on Incorrect Guesses:<u>

With each incorrect letter input, an icon's head, arms, body, and legs are formed. This visual progress allows the user to see their game status more clearly.

<u>Winning and Losing States:</u>

When the user correctly guesses the selected word, a "you won" message appears. If they couldn't guess it, a "you lost" message is displayed. These situations inform the user about their game results.

<u>Play Again and Reset:</u>

When the user chooses the "play again" option, the game is reset, and a new random word is selected. This allows the user to continuously try the game with a fresh start.
